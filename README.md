# EFK-Stack

EFK stackâ€™s prime objective is to reliably and securely retrieve data from the K8s cluster in any format, as well as to facilitate anytime searching, analysing, and visualising of the data.

## Includes:

1) Elasticsearch is a scalable and distributed search engine that is commonly used to store large amounts of log data. 
2) Fluent Bit is a logging and metrics processor and forwarder that is extremely fast, lightweight, and highly scalable. 
3) Kibana is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool for data visualization, querying, and dashboards. 

### The issues to tackle down with logging are:

* Having a centralized overview of all log events
* Normalizing different log types
* Automated processing of log messages
* Supporting several and very different event sources
